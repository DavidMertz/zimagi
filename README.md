# Zimagi overview

**Open Source Distributed Data Processing Platform**

Zimagi is a fast and powerful open source distributed data processing platform that empowers developers to implement powerful production-ready data pipelines with less code.

## Major Features

* Modular database driven API and processing platform built on Python, Django, Celery, and other popular open source technologies
* Auto-generated code base from architectural specifications _(production ready data, imports, and APIs with little or no code required)_
* Hosted API and / or CLI _(no server required to use or get started)_
* Micro-service APIs out of the box:
Secure and flexible streaming RPC command API for data updates and system management
* Fast and secure OpenAPI compatible REST API for searchable data access
* Pluggable architecture for extreme extensibility with version controlled modules
* Powerful, layered data centric orchestration language with query capabilities for advanced data processing workflows across clusters of machines
* Multi user role based management and access with command logging and auditing
* Strong encryption of sensitive data including platform state, configurations, and customizable fields _(communications and database backups are safe)_
* Integrated real-time, queued, and scheduled command execution
* Configurable user email notifications on command execution and failure

<br/>

# The Goal

Make it fast and easy to create powerful, scalable production ready APIs and distributed data processing services:

* Ready for our data
* In minutes or hours, not weeks, months, or years
* At a fraction of the cost of traditional development services or proprietary API platforms
* That are completely extensible and customizable, built on popular open source software

In short; **Go from concept and architecture to production data services in no time with little to no code**
