# Zimagi overview

**Open Source Distributed Data Processing Platform**

Zimagi is a fast and powerful open source distributed data processing platform that empowers developers to implement powerful production-ready data pipelines with less code.

<br/>

# The Goal

Make it fast and easy to create powerful, scalable production ready APIs and distributed data processing services:

* Ready for our data
* In minutes or hours, not weeks, months, or years
* At a fraction of the cost of traditional development services or proprietary API platforms
* That are completely extensible and customizable, built on popular open source software

In short; **Go from concept and architecture to production data services in no time with little to no code**
