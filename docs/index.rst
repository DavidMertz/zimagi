Zimagi System Documentation
#########################

Hello!  Welcome to the documentation site for the **Zimagi** project, a secure and modular infrastructure design and orchestration system built to integrate popular tools, systems, and cloud providers into a unified management experience, made for federated teams.

We like to think of this project as an *Infrastructure Content Management System (CMS)*.

This documentation is broken up into four sections.  The **About** section covers reasons for being, principles, architecture, and process information, so you can quickly get started and understand the project at various levels.  The **Commands**, **Tasks**, and **Profiles** sections provide information on the core capabilities, and are more useful as a reference if needed.

If you have ideas, feedback, or issues with this documentation please file an issue in the `Zimagi project <https://github.com/dccs-tech/zimagi/issues>`_ and we will address them as promptly as possible.
