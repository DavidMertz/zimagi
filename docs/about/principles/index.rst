When designing the **Zimagi** system, we have kept certain quiding principles and frameworks in mind to guide development and architecture over time.  Our goals are to encourage cooperative evolution so the software can stay relevant for a long time to come.  This way we can build a sizable and diverse repository of open and proprietary extensions taylored for organizations of all shapes and sizes *(an integration of popular technologies and processes)*.

**To help modernize infrastructure management we must follow successful modern practices.**
