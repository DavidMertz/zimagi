The **MCMI** project grew out of a desire to easily manufacture and manage federated infrastructure in a flexible manner, capable of adapting to the needs of the user while allowing for the most reuse possible.  We believe that the grand unification of physical computing systems and varied cloud service providers spread over the globe are going to be key to digital growth in the future for small and large organizations alike.

Data is increasingly becoming one of the most valuable economic resources, and with the increasing importance of data, the need for efficient networking, computing power, and storage capacity grows.  The world is also becoming increasingly automated, but that automation is often not integrated or standardized, reducing the effectiveness of the systems that rely on it and the people who manage it.

The following topics shed more light on the purpose of the **MCMI** system in regards to these global trends.  Above all we are attempting to create an open ecosystem for organizations looking to work seamlesly together to create the most efficient and cost effective infrastructure for their mission and operating models.
